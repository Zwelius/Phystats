## TODO List
Please be guided accordingly for some minor and major corrections.

### Forgivable Errors - Can be ignored for now, minor nitpicks
- [ ] Obsolete Styling Login/Signup/Profile Page
Update these pages with the current style. 

- [ ] Inconsistent Stylings on Table Elements
Make the width of the table be absolute instead of auto and to support for ellipse text overflowing for long names.

- [ ] Inconsistent Stylings on Content Containers
Primarily observable within the Add Student page where the container changes its width depending on the selected tab.

### Unforgivable Errors - A must-fix
- [ ] No Constraints on Forms
Especially important on the Add Student form. The user might have different use case that the developers have in mind which might accidentally break the program. Enforce your own use case by placing constraints.

- [ ] Missing Sorting Features
The lack of an integral promised feature is a no-no. For 50% qualifications, this is okay to ignore but this will be needed if we aim to achieve a 100%.
